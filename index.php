				<li>Also, DIY candles work the best when you come home after a long day of work. All you have to do is place a wick in 
				a jar and pour some melted wax in the jar with any colours and essential oils or some fragrance of your choice. Once the wax 
				cools down, your candle is ready to spread some magic in the air.</li>
				<li>You can apply wallpapers on the walls or even paint some designs with your hands if you have good painting skills. 
				You can also use stencils to paint which will make it easy for you to paint words or any other designs.
